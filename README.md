# NoSQL-challenge
---------------------------
The UK Food Standards Agency evaluates various establishments across the United Kingdom, and gives them a food hygiene rating. In this project we tried to evaluate some of the ratings data for a food magazine, Eat Safe, Love, in order to help their journalists and food critics decide where to focus future articles.

In the first part of the project, we used the data provided in the establishments.json file to create a NoSQL database using PyMongo.

In the second part, we made some changes to the database such as adding new restaurants, updating some information about each restaurant and changing the datatypes.

In the last part, we answered some specific questions that Eat Safe, Love magazine have asked :
1. Which establishments have a hygiene score equal to 20?
2. Which establishments in London have a RatingValue greater than or equal to 4?
3. What are the top 5 establishments with a RatingValue of '5', sorted by lowest hygiene score, nearest to the new restaurant added, "Penang Flavours"?
4. How many establishments in each Local Authority area have a hygiene score of 0?
